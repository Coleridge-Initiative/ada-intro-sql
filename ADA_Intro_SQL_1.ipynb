    "## Starting Out: Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a language designed for a very specific purpose: to interact with relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database**: A database is a structured collection of data. There are various different ways of structuring the database, and there may or may not be information about the relationship between entities in the database.\n",
    "- **Query**: A query is a request for data from the database. \n",
    "- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: A DBMS is a system of storing and managing databases, including querying the database.\n",
    "- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: In an RDBMS, data records are stored in *tables*, each of which has a predefined set of *columns*, the pieces of information captured for each record in a table, and *rows* in the table, where each row has a place to store a value for every column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, including their columns, column types and relationships with other tables, are defined in a database **schema**. Many times, tables will contain a **primary key**, one or more columns that uniquely define a row. You can think of the primary key as a kind of ID, in which each row is given a unique ID. Tables can also contain  **foreign keys**, which are column(s) that comprise the primary key in another table and, thus, provides a way of matching between multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we'll use data stored using the PostgreSQL RDBMS. In practice, there are many others that you could use, each with its own unique characteristics, but the basic principles of relational data will remain the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LIMIT:** We typically include a `LIMIT` statement at the end of our query so that we don't get overloaded with rows being output. Here, `LIMIT 10` means that we just want the first ten rows. Many times, the `LIMIT` that you want will be higher than 10 -- you might generally prefer to use 1000 or so. Having a `LIMIT` for all queries is highly recommended even if you know only a few rows will be shown, since it acts as a safety precaution against (for example) displaying millions of rows of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "> ### Side note about capitalization\n",
    "If you notice, we've been using all caps for SQL commands and all lowercase for data table and schema names. This is simply a convention, as SQL is not case sensitive. For example, we could have run \"`select * from ca_wac_2015 limit 10;`\" and it would have given us the exact same output as the first query. \n",
    "\n",

Now, we're not doing anything very insightful here, since the groups already split the blocks by how many jobs there are. However, as we'll see later on, these aggregation functions can be very useful. For example, suppose we had the county data that's in `ca_xwalk` in this table. We could find the average number of jobs per census block for each county in this way.\n",

    "> You may have noticed that we included a part using \"`AS`,\" followed by a new name, in the first line. When you ran the code, you might have noticed that the column labels were changed to these new names. This is called aliasing, and is done for readability and ease of access. Later on, aliasing will also help us more easily reference tables within the same query.  "
